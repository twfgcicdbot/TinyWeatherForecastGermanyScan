tl;dr -> scan code of [**TinyWeatherForecastGermany**](https://codeberg.org/Starfish/TinyWeatherForecastGermany) (TWFG) for tracker signatures provided by [**ExodusPrivacy**](https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/) using the python module [exodus-core](https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/exodus-core/)

[Tiny Weather Forecast Germany](https://tinyweatherforecastgermanygroup.gitlab.io/index/) is an android open source weather app focused on Germany developped by Pawel Dube ([@Starfish](https://codeberg.org/Starfish)) using [open data](https://opendata.dwd.de/) provided by Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD).

The DWD is Germany's **national weather agency** (similiar to **N**ational **O**ceanic **a**nd **A**tmospheric **A**dministration ([NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/about-our-agency)) in the US).

**Note**:

* *'TWFG'* is an inofficial abbreviation for ***T**iny **W**eather **F**orecast **G**ermany.*
* *[ExodusPrivacy](https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy)* also partially uses the alternative spelling *'Îµxodus'*. To maintain readability the author sticks to the first version without the leading greek character.

## Purpose -> *Why?*

*The non-profit running ExodusPrivacy provides [reports](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/de/reports/de.kaffeemitkoffein.tinyweatherforecastgermany/latest/) itself so ... why wasting resources when generating them on your own?*

At the time of writing (Mid-August 2021) ExodusPrivacy [only allows](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/de/analysis/submit/) the submission of apps retrieved directly either from Google Play Store or the open source F-Droid app store. But uploading apk files is not possible afaik. Waiting for the update approval process after releasing apps needs patience as (to my personal understanding) it needs interactions of human beings. So that's why I (*Jean-Luc Tibaux* -> [*@eUgEntOptIc44*](https://codeberg.org/eUgEntOptIc44)) setup [my own](https://twfgcicdbot.github.io/TinyWeatherForecastGermanyScan/) solution to scan the apk release artifacts of TWFG.

To scan apk files on your android mobile on your own please see either the [official ExodusPrivacy app](https://www.f-droid.org/en/packages/org.eu.exodus_privacy.exodusprivacy/) or [ClassyShark3xodus](https://bitbucket.org/oF2pks/fdroid-classyshark3xodus/src/master/ClassySharkAndroid/). The latter works 100% offline.

You'll find the 'official' reports generated by ExodusPrivacy themselves [here](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/de/reports/de.kaffeemitkoffein.tinyweatherforecastgermany/latest/).

## Generated reports

## Dependencies

* see [`requirements.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twfgcicdbot/TinyWeatherForecastGermanyScan/main/requirements.txt) for Python dependencies
* `exodus-core` requires the package `dexdump` to be installed --> therefore it is strongly recommended to use a Linux OS for this project
* `ripgrepy` requires `ripgrep` to be installed

### Installation of `dexdump` and `ripgrep` on ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install -y dexdump ripgrep
```
